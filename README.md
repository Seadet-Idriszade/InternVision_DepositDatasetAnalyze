Deposit Dataset Analysis
Objective

The main purpose of this analysis is to explore customer behavior patterns, credit ownership, and banking interactions using the deposit dataset.
The study also focuses on managing incomplete or inconsistent data to ensure high-quality insights and reliable conclusions.

Workflow:

Importing and exploring the deposit dataset to understand its structure, column types, and data completeness.

Identifying and resolving missing values in key attributes such as credit status, contact details, and demographic information.

Grouping and aggregating data by customer demographics including education, job category, and marital status  to detect meaningful relationships.

Analyzing behavioral trends, such as which demographic segments are more likely to possess credit.

Applying data cleaning and imputation, using the most frequent (dominant) value within each group to handle missing information effectively.

Tools Used:

Python

Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis

NumPy - for numerical processing

Seaborn - for advanced statistical visualizations

Matplotlib - for plotting and chart customization

Google Colab - as the primary development and analysis environment

Highlights of the Analysis:

Comprehensive distribution analysis of clients based on education, occupation, and marital status.

Identification of credit ownership patterns, showing which customer groups most frequently hold credit accounts.

Effective data cleaning strategy, using group-based dominant values to handle missing entries without losing dataset consistency.

Enhanced understanding of customer segments, supporting more informed decision-making for financial and marketing strategies.
